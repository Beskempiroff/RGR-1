                    <p>It's Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.</p> 
                    <p>Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation.</p> 
                <p>Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p>
                    <p>Is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. </p> 
                    <p>It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.</p> 
                    <p>It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
                    <p>Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.</p>
                    <p>Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a cycle-detecting garbage collection system.</p>
                    <p>Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.</p> 
                    <p>Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.</p>
                    <p>Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.</p>
